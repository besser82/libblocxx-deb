	* out of the header file.  This is done by declaring
	* <PRE>
	*   class FooImpl;
	*   class Foo : private RefcountedPimpl<FooImpl>
	*   {
	*      ...
	*   };
	* </PRE>
	* and using @c pimpl() in @c Foo member functions to access the
	* internal data.  The @c Foo object is a wrapper around a reference-counted
	* pointer to a @c FooImpl object.
	*
	* @pre @a Impl is derived from <tt>BloCxx::IntrusiveCountableBase</tt>.
